# FlaskAPI

Requirements for this project can be found at https://github.com/csfeeser/Python/blob/master/TLG/flask_project.md

This is just a small API to demonstrate flask and to be able to make requests to an endpoint and retrieve a JSON
It has multiple endpoints, some that render html and use jinja2 logic


I'm so sorry it's not a throrough Spaceballs API!
It's a little dynamic, but still somewhat hardcoded, so wouldn't apply if other questions were added to the dictionary and used
I would also like to use radio buttons instead of entering information
